  pimhasher is a program inspired by VeraCrypt's PIM (Personal Iterations
  Multiplier) feature, designed to provide the same functionality for LUKS
  (Linux Unified Key Setup).


Installation and Setup

  To use pimhasher, follow these steps:

    1. Compile and install
       Build the project and install it on your system.

    2. Configure /etc/crypttab
       Add the keyscript option to the desired volume in your crypttab
       configuration file.


Example Configuration

  An example entry for the crypttab file:

example-volume UUID="" none luks,keyscript=pimhasher

  Replace example-volume and UUID with the appropriate identifiers for
  your setup.


Speed
  Computing 1,000,000 rounds takes approximately 2.5 seconds on an Intel
  i7-2600 CPU, with no support for multithreading.
